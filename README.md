# js-frameworks CA eCom store

## Description

This is a school assignment where I was tasked with creating an eCommerce store using **React**. I chose to also use **Vite**. The requirements included:

- Fetch products from an API and display them on the homepage in product cards.
- Allow users to click on a product to view detailed information on a separate page.
- Implement a search functionality to filter products by their title.
- Display detailed product information, including original and discounted prices.
- Show customer reviews for each product.

Additional features I implemented include:

- A cart system is built using Zustand, and the cart icon shows the number of items.
- Toast notifications when products are added to the cart.
- From the product page, items can be added to the cart, and on the checkout page the user can see a summary and complete the order.
- On successful checkout, a success message is shown and the cart is cleared.
- The Contact page includes a validated form (name, subject, email, message) that logs the data to the console once all inputs are valid.
- Responsive design using CSS.
- Routing with React Router.
