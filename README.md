# js-frameworks CA eCom store

## Description

This is a school assignment where I was tasked with creating an eCommerce store using React. The requirements were to fetch products from an API and display them on the homepage. They were to be shown in product cards, each with a button that takes the user to the individual product based on its ID. In addition, the user should be able to use a search field to search for products by their title. On the product page, I have retrieved all the information from the API and display both the original price, the discounted price, and a review section where the product shows reviews from other customers who have purchased it.
